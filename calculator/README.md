# README

This is an implementation from the exercise on https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/11/calculator.

I'm choosing to implement this from scratch this time.

I will attempt to create two classes:
- The console listener (This will manage user interaction)
  - This was called `Runner`
- The calculator
  - `Calculator`

## Exercise requirements:
- Create a console app that allows the user to input two numbers and one of the four basic arithmetic operations

## Things I feel like doing while I'm here
- Make the calculator obnoxiously friendly (and see how C# handles unix signals).
  - Alright, it got a little too obnoxious, but in my defence, this task is very simple.
- Figure out what `namespace` means precisely in C#
  - It's like a module in Ruby afaik.  I don't think I need it in such a small project?
